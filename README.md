# Gakusei

Gakusei is an online (and real-time) tool to study and test your Japanese knowledge.
It can generate thousands of different sentences by rearranging words and sentences, although its vocabulary is a bit limited right now.

## Try it online

There's also an [android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.squallstar.gakusei) wrapper for your pleasure.

## Or run it locally

```

(if you don't have meteor, head up here https://www.meteor.com/)
